This folder contains implementation files for PACT Tag. To evaluate the communication range of our system and co-existance of tags we, have used AX5043 radio on Tag controlled by MSP430FR2355 microcontroller. 

* AX5043_MSP430FR2355 folder contains required hardware connections and Sotware codes for programming AX5043 radio using MSP430 MCU.
* AX5043_FPGA folder contains required hardware connections and Sotware codes for programming AX5043 radio using Lattice Semiconductor's iCE40LX FPGA.
